# javascript-localStorage-practice

This code is a real world implementation for local storage
When you enter a website and then change its theme to a dark theme for example and leave the website, the theme will still be there when you visit the website again because this information is stored in the local storage of the browser that you are using.

This is a simple code that let you choose one of the 4 available color options for your div element. The information will be saved even if you reload the website as I have mentioned above.

## notes

#### some of the key concepts that you need to understand are:

#### --higher order functions
#### --document object model(DOM)
#### --browser object model(BOM)
